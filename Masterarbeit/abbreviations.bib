	information system featuring an integrated set of genome annotation,
	databases and other information for chordate and selected model organism
	and disease vector genomes. As of release 47 (October 2007), Ensembl
	fully supports 35 species, with preliminary support for six additional
	species. New species in the past year include platypus and horse.
	Major additions and improvements to Ensembl since our previous report
	include extensive support for functional genomics data in the form
	of a specialized functional genomics database, genome-wide maps of
	protein–DNA interactions and the Ensembl regulatory build; support
	for customization of the Ensembl web interface through the addition
	of user accounts and user groups; and increased support for genome
	resequencing. We have also introduced new comparative genomics-based
	data mining options and report on the continued development of our
	software infrastructure.},
